# Business Overview/Problem

 The prevailing business challenge is to optimize the marketing and advertisement strategy for Sway's second album release to ensure it gains global recognition and success. Some challenges include:

1. Limited Global Reach: Presently, Sway's popularity is confined to specific regional pockets, posing a significant hurdle in achieving global recognition. A crucial task is expanding Sway's fan base to encompass a worldwide audience, thereby broadening the album's reach.

2. Intense Competition: The music industry operates within an environment of cutthroat competition, intensifying the difficulties faced by emerging artists. Navigating this fiercely competitive landscape necessitates a carefully crafted advertising strategy that can help Sway stand out amidst a sea of talent.
3. Evolving Consumer Preferences: The music consumption landscape is continuously shifting, driven by rapid changes in technology and consumer behavior. Staying attuned to these dynamic preferences is imperative, as it demands continuous adaptation and innovation in our marketing approach to effectively connect with the target audience on the platforms they favor.

# Rationale for the Project
 
Marketing & Advertising analysis will help SunMusic reduce business risks, effectively connect with the target audience, provide the right songs, and align with the latest music trends. It provides the data and insights necessary to develop a targeted and effective marketing strategy that aligns with the business objective of achieving global recognition and success. These will address the business problems through:

1. Data-Driven Decision Making: Marketing analytics provides valuable insights and data-driven intelligence that can guide decision-makers in crafting an effective marketing strategy. By analyzing data, businesses can identify which regions or countries have the most potential for growth and allocate resources accordingly.
 
2. Audience Segmentation: Analytics can help identify and segment the target audience in regions where Sway is not prominent. By understanding the demographics, preferences, and behaviors of potential fans, marketing efforts can be tailored to resonate with specific audience segments.
 
3. Campaign Effectiveness: Analytics can track the performance of marketing campaigns in real-time. This means that if a particular campaign is not yielding the desired results in a specific region, adjustments can be made quickly to improve its effectiveness.
 
4. Platform Optimization: Given the evolving consumer preferences and the importance of digital platforms, analytics can help identify which online channels and platforms are most effective for reaching and engaging with the target audience.

# Recommendations

In order to enhance her marketing optimization efforts, Sway should capitalize on additional social media platforms to expand her fanbase by  increasing her social presence and interaction on platforms where she's lagging behind such as Twitter and Tik-Tok. This approach will not only bolster her social media engagement but also contribute to increased streaming figures and  album sales.

## Listeners within the age of 39-45 engaged the most with Sway's music. In order to expand her audience to other age group, Sway can:

1. Experiment with different musical styles or genres that appeal to a broader demographic. This may involve collaborating with artists from other genres or incorporating elements from various musical traditions.
2. Create content, such as music videos or lyric videos, that resonates with different age groups. For example, she could create videos with themes or storylines that appeal to a younger audience or produce content that connects with older listeners.
3. Collaborate with artists who have fans in other age ranges such as Rhythmic Rival and Melodic Maven can help Sway tap into new audiences. These collaborations can introduce her music to a wider demographic.

## Sway's has more low income level earners as listeners, to attract a more diverse audience that includes medium and high-income individuals:

4. Consider advertising in upscale magazines, lifestyle blogs, or social media platforms popular among medium and high-income demographics.
5. Create ad campaigns tailored to the interests and preferences of medium and high-income individuals.
6. Collaborate with established artists who have a following among medium and high-income audiences. These collaborations can introduce her to new fans.
7. Partner with social media influencers or bloggers who have a significant following among the desired demographic. Their endorsement can help her gain credibility and reach.
8. Partner with charitable organizations or causes that resonate with medium and high-income individuals. This can help her connect with those who appreciate socially conscious artists. 

## Sway's listeners are more in Melbourne, to expand her listener base in locations beyond Melbourne, the following strategies can be employed:

9. Create marketing campaigns specifically tailored to each of the other locations where she has listeners. This can include localized social media advertising, event promotions, and targeted outreach.
10. Collaborate with artists and influencers from those regions to tap into their local fan base. Joint projects or performances can help her gain visibility in new areas.
Reach out to local radio stations, and online publications in those areas. Getting featured in local media and magazine shoot, for example 'Vogue Asia' , or Glamour Africa help introduce her music to a broader local audience.
11. Plan concerts or mini-tours in the regions where she wants to expand her listener base.

12. On acquisition channel, it seems like a lot of listeners came in through adverts, Sway's team should continue investing in advertising campaigns that have proven successful in acquiring listeners and this medium should have a larger portion of the budget funds. 

Because spotify and youtube was the most used streaming platform, a lot of energy should be directed there during market, and the team can also focus on where she is rarely known such as tidal.
